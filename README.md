Word embedding is a technique in deep learning where words are represented as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. Unlike traditional one-hot encoding, which is sparse and lacks semantic understanding, word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText capture both syntactic and semantic relationships between words based on their usage in large text corpora. These embeddings provide several key advantages in natural language processing (NLP). They encode semantic meaning—allowing relationships like *king - man + woman = queen*—which helps models understand word context and improves tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and question answering. By representing words in lower-dimensional spaces (typically 100–300 dimensions), embeddings reduce computational complexity while preserving important linguistic patterns. They also enhance generalization by positioning similar words (e.g., “car” and “automobile”) closer together in the vector space, making models more robust and accurate. Pretrained embeddings enable transfer learning, allowing models to benefit from prior training on large datasets, thereby reducing training time and data requirements for new tasks. Furthermore, contextual embeddings from models like BERT and GPT capture the meaning of words based on surrounding context, enabling nuanced understanding in complex NLP applications. Overall, word embeddings have significantly advanced NLP by allowing machines to better grasp and process human language.
